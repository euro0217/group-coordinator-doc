*Group Coordinator* is an app designed to easily create optimal groups based on various attributes of members and the set number of people per group. It allows you to either gather people with the same attributes in one group or, conversely, ensure that groups consist of people with diverse attributes.

Let's explain using the diagram above as an example. There are twelve people and we want to divide them into three groups (numbers of people in groups are respectively 6, 4 and 2).

people's attributes are depicted by the colors (blue and orange) and the shape (circle, triangle and square). Please think of these colors and shapes as abstractions of familiar attributes like belongings, genders, hobbies, academic records, favorite foods, birthmonth, etc.

In the diagram, two groupings are represented as outputs. In the first one (left), it is aimed to keep people of the same color as far apart as possible, while trying to keep people with the same shape in the same group. In the other one (right), the opposite is done by trying to keep people of the same color in the same group as much as possible, while having various shapes within each group. Of course, depending on the conditions, there may be some awkwardness in the output, like the person at the top right having a circle in the left output, but you can see things are mostly going well as the way you want.

Such groupings often become unexpectedly difficult when there are dozens or more people or due to the increasing number of attributes to consider.

This is when this app comes in handy.

I hope this app proves useful in the following areas.

* classrooms, education
* corporate HR departments
* party, social gathering
* sports club
* etc. ... in the field I have never imagined.
